"I approached this problem by first conducting a root cause analysis using the 5-Whys technique. I discovered the underlying issue was inconsistent data encoding across three upstream systems. I standardised encoding in a shared utility library, wrote unit tests for edge cases, and documented the decision in our ADR system. The fix eliminated that class of bug entirely for the following 18 months.",Behavioral,63.0,0,1.0,1,15.75,medium,strong
My approach to technical debt is to treat it as a first-class backlog item. I introduced a rule that 20 percent of every sprint is reserved for tech debt. I built a dashboard tracking cyclomatic complexity over time and presented it to leadership as a risk metric. Over 6 months we reduced our critical debt score by 60 percent while maintaining feature velocity.,Technical,63.0,0,1.0,1,15.75,medium,strong

To scale our ML training pipeline I implemented a distributed training strategy using PyTorch DDP across 4 GPUs. I also introduced mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing which reduced GPU memory by 40 percent and cut training time from 14 hours to 3.5 hours while maintaining model accuracy within 0.2 percent of the baseline.,Behavioral,53.0,0,1.0,1,,medium,strong

"Situation: Our recommendation system had a latency of 800ms which was causing a 15 percent drop-off. Task: I was asked to reduce it to under 200ms. Action: I profiled the service, identified that 70 percent of latency came from a redundant database call, cached results with Redis, and vectorised the scoring loop using NumPy. Result: Latency dropped to 140ms, drop-off decreased by 12 percent, and we saved roughly 30 percent in compute costs.",Technical,,0,1.0,1,18.25,medium,strong

Using the STAR method: in my last role our data pipeline was failing silently every weekend. I designed an alerting system using Airflow sensors and Slack webhooks. I also added a data quality layer using Great Expectations.
